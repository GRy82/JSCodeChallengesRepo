// Two cats and a mouse are at various positions on a line. You will be
// given their starting positions. Your task is to determine which cat 
// will reach the mouse first, assuming the mouse does not move and the 
// cats travel at equal speed. If the cats arrive at the same time, the 
// // mouse will be allowed to move and it will escape while they fight.

//You are given q queries in the form of x, y, and z representing the 
// respective positions for cats A and B, and for mouse C. Complete the 
// function catAndMouse to return the appropriate answer to each query, 
// which will be printed on a new line.

// - If cat A catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
// - If cat B catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
// - If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the 
//   two cats fight and mouse escapes.
