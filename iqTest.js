// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to 
// find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed 
// that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to 
// check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one 
// that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means
// indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
